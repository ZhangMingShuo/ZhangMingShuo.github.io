> TRUNCATE 
  SQL query removes all rows from a table, without logging the individual row deletions.    
  TRUNCATE is a DDL command   
  TRUNCATE is executed using a table lock and whole table is locked for remove all records.   
  We cannot use WHERE clause with TRUNCATE.   
  TRUNCATE removes all rows from a table. 
  Minimal logging in transaction log, so it is faster performance wise. 
  TRUNCATE TABLE removes the data by deallocating the data pages used to store the table data and records only the page deallocations in the transaction log.   
  Identify column is reset to its seed value if table contains any identity column.   
  To use Truncate on a table you need at least ALTER permission on the table.   
  Truncate uses less transaction space than the Delete statement.   
  Truncate cannot be used with indexed views.   
  TRUNCATE is faster than DELETE.
